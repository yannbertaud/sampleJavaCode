### Sample Java code

Some sample java code to illustrate different things such as
* writing to a json file with Gson
* reading a json file with Gson



Running the sample code
from the command line, go to root folder and type:

```mvn clean install exec:java```

Note: this is work in progress and more things will get added
as I come up with solutions for different problems that I run into.
